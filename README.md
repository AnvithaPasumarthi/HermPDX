Why Herm? Because (Herm)es and (Herm)od are both Gods of Speed in their respective mythologies and Herm aims for time-efficiency.

Herm is a web application for delivery drivers, cab drivers, and the populace to easily reach numerous locations in a minimal and time-efficient fashion.

Herm will be built using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS. We decided on using React because it is easy to learn and convenient. Also, it renders updates faster, ensuring faster performance.
